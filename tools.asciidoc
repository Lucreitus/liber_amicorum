== Tools

This section attempts to map the key tools.  The goal is not so much to provide an exhaustive reference, but more to give a good overview of what the tool is, who the heavyweights in the field are, and list some interesting work. Here are a few examples:

* arduino
* cinder
* kinect
* max
* 3D printers

For each tool, we'd like to see:

* The quickest possible description.  We're not looking to recreate wikipedia.
* What it's commonly used for
* Important details, like whether it's free software
* The heavyweights in the field
* A list of interesting projects and examples
* Resources and community support
* Similar tools
