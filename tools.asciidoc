== Tools

This section attempts to map the key tools. The goal is not so much to provide an exhaustive reference, but more to give a good overview of what the tool is, who the heavyweights in the field are, and list some interesting work. Here are a few examples:

* arduino
* cinder
* kinect
* max
* 3D printers

For each tool, we'd like to see:

* A succinct description; we're not looking to recreate Wikipedia
* What the tool is commonly used for
* Important details, such as whether it's free software
* Heavyweights in the field who use the tool
* A list of interesting projects and examples
* Resources and community support
* Similar tools
