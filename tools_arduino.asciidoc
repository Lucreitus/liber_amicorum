=== Arduino
   
Arduino--one of the most successful open-source hardware projects ever--is a micro-controller and programming environment intended primarily for artists, designers, hobbyists, and students. It is particularly useful for quick prototyping because of the flexibility and ease-of-use of both the software and hardware. The software includes an IDE built on Processing and Wiring. 

Both the hardware and software are open source, so you can build-your-own Arduino, or buy one pre-assembled. In addition, many specialized versions have been created for specific uses, such as the Lilypad Arduino for wearable computing (official Arduino project) and the Boarduino, a breadboard-compatible clone. http://www.ladyada.net/make/boarduino/
