=== Max/MSP & Jitter

Max is a visual dataflow programming environment for music and multimedia whose GUI reflects the structure of the program you're writing, where objects in the code are displayed on the screen and are connected to each other via inlets and outlets, in a similar way to how a sound engineer might connect analog inputs to processors and outputs. Following the metaphor, Max operates in response to “bangs,” which are initiating events, much like an electric current running through a synthesizer. MSP is a plug-in for Max that allows real-time manipulation of digital audio signals, and is designed to be fairly easy to start using and prototype with. When you think Max, you're probably really thinking Max/MSP.
