== Projects

The goal of the projects section is to articulate the vision and thoughts that go into creating an interesting work or solving an interesting problem, with a particular focus on the project's relevance compared to other computational / serial artists or projects.  

We're much more interested in the "whys" of the project -- why did you pick certain tools, why did you take the approach, why is this different than what's come before -- before the "hows".  (But, don't worry -- you can put the hows in the tutorial or example sections.)  The project descriptions should serve as a guide of your thinking for people who will follow after you.  

* What was the project?
* What areas or field does it fall in?
* What tools did you use?
* Why was this an interesting project to you -- what was new or innovative?
* What were the key challenges you had to overcome?
* Your name and a brief bio
