=== OpenCV
   
OpenCV is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. It's widely used and supported by people working on real-time computer vision such as face detection, camera tracking, augmented reality, and anything else cool that you see done with cameras. The library has thousands of algorithms that can be used to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions in videos, track camera movements, track movement, extract 3D models of objects, produce 3D point clouds from stereo cameras, stitch images together, find similar images from a database, recognize scenery and establish markers for augmented reality applications, and much, much more.
