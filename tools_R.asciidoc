[[R]]
=== R: The R Project for Statistical Computing

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It's an open source version / different implementation of S. Originally written by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka of the Univeristy of Auckland, it is now collaborative effort with its own foundation and core contributors. It's widely used for data analytics, data mining, machine learning, data visualization. It's what you need for Big Data projects, basically. R is particularly useful because it's so extensible. Thousands of packages have been written to help R handle certain kinds of data from climate information to speech. This link:http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/["Task View"]page offers an overview of some of the ways R has been applied.
